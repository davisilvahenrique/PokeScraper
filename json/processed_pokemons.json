This includes the status move  Thunder Wave . The ability is most useful in double/triple battles. When hit by the move, it deals no damage to the ability-bearer but raises its Special Attack by one stage. Stats can be raised to a maximum of +6 stages each. Lightning Rod  will activate for an Electric-type  Hidden Power , but not Electric-type  Judgment . The ability is overridden by other Pokémon becoming the  center of attention  from the moves  Follow Me  or  Rage Powder . In  Generations 3-4 ,  Lightning Rod  did not increase Special Attack nor give immunity to Electric-type attacks. It also did not activate for  Hidden Power . In  Generations 3-5 , this ability's name was formatted as  Lightningrod ."

It also increases the chance of flinching due to the held items  King's Rock  and  Razor Fang  from 10% to 20% (however, note that those items do not affect moves that already have a flinch chance). Serene Grace  does not affect status moves or the Pokémon's critical hit ratio. Shadow Ball  normally has a 20% chance of lowering Special Defense; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 40% chance. Air Slash  has a 30% of causing the target to flinch; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 60% chance. If the item  King's Rock  is held it does not increase that percentage, but rather if the move does not cause flinching (40% chance), then there is now a further 20% chance the target will flinch from  King's Rock . This means  Serene Grace  with  Air Slash  and  King's Rock  gives a total probability of 68% (1 - 0.4*0.8) that the opponent will flinch. In  Generations 3-4   Serene Grace  does not increase the flinch chance of  King's Rock  or Razor Fang. In  Generations 3-5   Serene Grace  does not affect the move  Secret Power ."

Serene Grace  does not affect status moves or the Pokémon's critical hit ratio. Shadow Ball  normally has a 20% chance of lowering Special Defense; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 40% chance. Air Slash  has a 30% of causing the target to flinch; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 60% chance. If the item  King's Rock  is held it does not increase that percentage, but rather if the move does not cause flinching (40% chance), then there is now a further 20% chance the target will flinch from  King's Rock .

Serene Grace  does not affect status moves or the Pokémon's critical hit ratio. Shadow Ball  normally has a 20% chance of lowering Special Defense; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 40% chance. Air Slash  has a 30% of causing the target to flinch; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 60% chance. If the item  King's Rock  is held it does not increase that percentage, but rather if the move does not cause flinching (40% chance), then there is now a further 20% chance the target will flinch from  King's Rock . This means  Serene Grace  with  Air Slash  and  King's Rock  gives a total probability of 68% (1 - 0.4*0.8) that the opponent will flinch.

Serene Grace  does not affect status moves or the Pokémon's critical hit ratio. Shadow Ball  normally has a 20% chance of lowering Special Defense; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 40% chance. Air Slash  has a 30% of causing the target to flinch; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 60% chance. If the item  King's Rock  is held it does not increase that percentage, but rather if the move does not cause flinching (40% chance), then there is now a further 20% chance the target will flinch from  King's Rock . This means  Serene Grace  with  Air Slash  and  King's Rock  gives a total probability of 68% (1 - 0.4*0.8) that the opponent will flinch. In  Generations 3-4   Serene Grace  does not increase the flinch chance of  King's Rock  or Razor Fang. In  Generations 3-5   Serene Grace  does not affect the move  Secret Power ."

Serene Grace  does not affect status moves or the Pokémon's critical hit ratio. Shadow Ball  normally has a 20% chance of lowering Special Defense; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 40% chance. Air Slash  has a 30% of causing the target to flinch; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 60% chance. If the item  King's Rock  is held it does not increase that percentage, but rather if the move does not cause flinching (40% chance), then there is now a further 20% chance the target will flinch from  King's Rock . This means  Serene Grace  with  Air Slash  and  King's Rock  gives a total probability of 68% (1 - 0.4*0.8) that the opponent will flinch. In  Generations 3-4   Serene Grace  does not increase the flinch chance of  King's Rock  or Razor Fang. In  Generations 3-5   Serene Grace  does not affect the move  Secret Power ."

Flamethrower  normally has a 10% chance to burn the opponent. With  Sheer Force , Flamethrower's base power is boosted from 95 to 124, but it will never cause a burn. Note that if a move has an advantageous  and  disadvantageous side-effect,  Sheer Force  still boosts the move but only the advantageous effect is removed. For example,  Flare Blitz  may cause a burn but also has recoil damage. A Pokémon with  Sheer Force  using the move would gain the power increase and still receive recoil damage, but it would never cause a burn.

                "description": "Serene Grace  doubles the chance of moves' secondary effects occurring - specifically stat changes, status ailments, or flinching. It also increases the chance of flinching due to the held items  King's Rock  and  Razor Fang  from 10% to 20% (however, note that those items do not affect moves that already have a flinch chance). Serene Grace  does not affect status moves or the Pokémon's critical hit ratio. Shadow Ball  normally has a 20% chance of lowering Special Defense; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 40% chance. Air Slash  has a 30% of causing the target to flinch; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 60% chance. If the item  King's Rock  is held it does not increase that percentage, but rather if the move does not cause flinching (40% chance), then there is now a further 20% chance the target will flinch from  King's Rock . This means  Serene Grace  with  Air Slash  and  King's Rock  gives a total probability of 68% (1 - 0.4*0.8) that the opponent will flinch. In  Generations 3-4   Serene Grace  does not increase the flinch chance of  King's Rock  or Razor Fang. In  Generations 3-5   Serene Grace  does not affect the move  Secret Power ."

Serene Grace  does not affect status moves or the Pokémon's critical hit ratio. Shadow Ball  normally has a 20% chance of lowering Special Defense; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 40% chance. Air Slash  has a 30% of causing the target to flinch; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 60% chance. If the item  King's Rock  is held it does not increase that percentage, but rather if the move does not cause flinching (40% chance), then there is now a further 20% chance the target will flinch from  King's Rock . This means  Serene Grace  with  Air Slash  and  King's Rock  gives a total probability of 68% (1 - 0.4*0.8) that the opponent will flinch. In  Generations 3-4   Serene Grace  does not increase the flinch chance of  King's Rock  or Razor Fang. In  Generations 3-5   Serene Grace  does not affect the move  Secret Power ."

Pokémon with  Pickup  will also obtain an item thrown at them with  Fling  (if they are not already holding anything). In  Generations 3-4 ,  Pickup  has no effect in battle. When a battle ends, any party Pokémon with  Pickup  has a 10% chance of picking up an item (if they are not already holding an item). Items picked up range from Potions, Great Balls, Ultra Balls and Rare Candies up to Leftovers and some TMs. Better items have a lower chance of being found; furthermore, higher-level Pokémon will obtain better items."

Serene Grace  does not affect status moves or the Pokémon's critical hit ratio. Shadow Ball  normally has a 20% chance of lowering Special Defense; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 40% chance. Air Slash  has a 30% of causing the target to flinch; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 60% chance. If the item  King's Rock  is held it does not increase that percentage, but rather if the move does not cause flinching (40% chance), then there is now a further 20% chance the target will flinch from  King's Rock . This means  Serene Grace  with  Air Slash  and  King's Rock  gives a total probability of 68% (1 - 0.4*0.8) that the opponent will flinch. In  Generations 3-4   Serene Grace  does not increase the flinch chance of  King's Rock  or Razor Fang. In  Generations 3-5   Serene Grace  does not affect the move  Secret Power ."

Serene Grace  does not affect status moves or the Pokémon's critical hit ratio. Shadow Ball  normally has a 20% chance of lowering Special Defense; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 40% chance. Air Slash  has a 30% of causing the target to flinch; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 60% chance. If the item  King's Rock  is held it does not increase that percentage, but rather if the move does not cause flinching (40% chance), then there is now a further 20% chance the target will flinch from  King's Rock . This means  Serene Grace  with  Air Slash  and  King's Rock  gives a total probability of 68% (1 - 0.4*0.8) that the opponent will flinch. In  Generations 3-4   Serene Grace  does not increase the flinch chance of  King's Rock  or Razor Fang. In  Generations 3-5   Serene Grace  does not affect the move  Secret Power ."

Note that if a move has an advantageous  and  disadvantageous side-effect,  Sheer Force  still boosts the move but only the advantageous effect is removed. For example,  Flare Blitz  may cause a burn but also has recoil damage. A Pokémon with  Sheer Force  using the move would gain the power increase and still receive recoil damage, but it would never cause a burn. Here are the moves that increase in power under  Sheer Force , listed alphabetically:"

Flamethrower  normally has a 10% chance to burn the opponent. With  Sheer Force , Flamethrower's base power is boosted from 95 to 124, but it will never cause a burn.

The effect lasts 5 turns, unless it is cleared via  Air Lock  or  Cloud Nine  or replaced by another weather condition. If multiple Pokémon with weather-generating abilities ( Snow Warning ,  Drizzle ,  Drought  or  Sand Stream ) enter the field on the same turn, each weather condition will activate consecutively, fastest Pokémon first. In other words, the resultant weather condition will be that of the slowest Pokémon. Prior to  Generation 6 ,  Snow Warning  lasts indefinitely upon activation."

Beneficial  effects are defined as those that are positive for the user, such as: Non-beneficial effects, that  Sheer Force  will not activate for, include: If the user is holding a  Life Orb  and uses an attack that activates  Sheer Force , it will not receive the 10% damage from  Life Orb , but it gets boosts from both  Life Orb  and  Sheer Force  (total of 69% base power increase). Flamethrower  normally has a 10% chance to burn the opponent. With  Sheer Force , Flamethrower's base power is boosted from 95 to 124, but it will never cause a burn. Note that if a move has an advantageous  and  disadvantageous side-effect,  Sheer Force  still boosts the move but only the advantageous effect is removed. For example,  Flare Blitz  may cause a burn but also has recoil damage. A Pokémon with  Sheer Force  using the move would gain the power increase and still receive recoil damage, but it would never cause a burn. Here are the moves that increase in power under  Sheer Force , listed alphabetically:"

It also increases the chance of flinching due to the held items  King's Rock  and  Razor Fang  from 10% to 20% (however, note that those items do not affect moves that already have a flinch chance). Serene Grace  does not affect status moves or the Pokémon's critical hit ratio. Shadow Ball  normally has a 20% chance of lowering Special Defense; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 40% chance. Air Slash  has a 30% of causing the target to flinch; with  Serene Grace  it is boosted to a 60% chance. If the item  King's Rock  is held it does not increase that percentage, but rather if the move does not cause flinching (40% chance), then there is now a further 20% chance the target will flinch from  King's Rock . This means  Serene Grace  with  Air Slash  and  King's Rock  gives a total probability of 68% (1 - 0.4*0.8) that the opponent will flinch. In  Generations 3-4   Serene Grace  does not increase the flinch chance of  King's Rock  or Razor Fang. In  Generations 3-5   Serene Grace  does not affect the move  Secret Power ."
